## Code

### 1 Check whether given number is prime or not?

\small
```{.py}
# Check whether given integer is prime, using the Fermat's test as a heuristic,
# then doing simple division checks
def primalty(n):
    # eliminate possibility of number being even
    if n == 2:
        return True
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return False

    # Fermat's test
    a = n - 1 # always co prime to n
    test_result = pow(a, n - 1, n) # (a ^ (n - 1)) % n

    if test_result != 1:
        # not prime
        return False

    divisor = 3
    while divisor * divisor <= n:
        if n % divisor == 0:
            return False
        divisor += 1

    return True
```
\normalsize

### 2 find GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) or given two numbers

\small
```{.py}
# Finds the gcd of two given positive integers 
# Uses euclid's method
# does not work if both the inputs are 0
def gcd(a, b):
    smaller = min(a, b) 
    larger = max(a, b)

    while smaller != 0:
        smaller, larger = larger % smaller, smaller

    return larger
```
\normalsize

### 3 check whether given numbers are relatively prime or not?

\small
```{.py}
# checks whether a and b are co-prime
def coprime(a, b):
    return gcd(a, b) == 1

```
\normalsize

### 4 find multiplicative inverse of given two numbers

\small
```{.py}
# finds the coefficients of a, b in expression where they express GCD as their
# linear combination
# requires that a > b
def extended_euclidian(a, b):
    old_r, r = a, b
    old_s, s = 1, 0
    old_t, t = 0, 1

    while r != 0:
        # old_r, r form the current pair

        q = old_r // r
        old_r, r = r, old_r - q * r

        # calculate new Bezout coefficients using the old coefficients
        old_s, s = s, old_s - q * s
        old_t, t = t, old_t - q * t


    return old_r, old_s, old_t

# finds (a ^ (-1)) % n
def multiplicative_inverse(a, n):
    remainder, coeff_n, coeff_a = extended_euclidian(n, a)

    assert remainder == 1

    # 1 = coeff_n * n + coeff_a * a

    return coeff_a if coeff_a > 0 else (coeff_a + n)
```
\normalsize

### 5 implement RSA algorithm
\small
```{.py}
# encrypts or decrypts single byte (operation is common)
def rsa_process(msg, key):
    exp, n = key

    # (msg ^ exp) % n
    return pow(msg, exp, n)
```

## Statistics

The file used for encryption is an ASCII text file having size **1 MB**

The average time needed for encryption (3 repetionts, different keys each time)
is **1.30s**

The average time needed for decryption (3 repetitions, different keys each time)
is  **1.37s**

## Notes
- The encryption input is restricted to characters whose binary encoded value is
  < 128

- p and q must be such that 
	128 < p * q <= 256

- This is done to avoid the problem of ciphertext size being different from
  plaintext size. 

- The last bit in the byte can be considered as *padding*

- The time required for encryption or decryption depends on the exponent- this
  is the reason why the decryption time is more- the keys were such that the
  exponent in the public key was lesser than the one in the private key, or the
  two were almost equal
